Built with the following:

Qt Creator 3.3.1 (opensource)
gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609
Based on Qt5.4.1

The following application written in C++11 based on QML (QtQuick 2.0) will keep tracking the info in "/proc/cpuInfo" 
and display it in a table view. In case the parsing of the data file fails, the whole raw data is merely displayed.
